The Google Play Store and the Apple App Store combined give users a choice of well over 5 million apps.  One would think that the answer to every “is there an app for that?” question imaginable would be a definitive “yes”!  Yet the answer to these sorts of conversations is typically a more nuanced one in which there may or may not be an appropriate app available for the proposed use case, and if there is, it often does not fully address the use case being considered. Hence, despite the crowded app ecosystems, there is still plenty of opportunity for innovation in the app space.
The GVSU Applied Computing Institute has been innovating in apps for well over a decade now.  We are particularly interested in experimentally validating emerging app techniques in the wild, and/or building custom apps that collect specialized research data sets.  We refer to this as activity app research.  Whether you are a university researcher looking for assistance in a custom app to help gather data, or you are an industry partner looking for help prototyping a speculative app concept, we can help you.

A few hundred years ago only a privileged few had access to education. The general people had to depend on these chosen few to guide them to the right path. Then, we democratized education, allowing everyone to access literacy and enlightenment. This democratization helped the human race to prosper exponentially in every field of knowledge. Andrew Ng, a co-founder of Google Brain, said that, right now, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI & ML) are almost what education was two hundred years ago. A crystal ball that only a chosen few understand and take advantage of, and everyone else depends on this chosen few to help the rest make an informed decision. However, what if we democratize AI? What if we allow AI & ML to be pervasive, not just limited to the big tech, but also helping the small businesses benefit from its enormous capabilities?
The GVSU Applied Computing Institute is trying to bridge this very gap. Our focus primarily lies in applied machine learning, where we take a business problem and try to tackle it through state-of-the-art AI & ML techniques. Some of our research projects are the following: Use audio ML detection to better oral care regimen; use NLP techniques to predict the potential success of an online course or a fundraiser campaign; use transformers, knowledge graphs, and information retrieval techniques to auto-generate software tests from software requirements; build a chatbot using NLP to scale your customer service experience, etc. Whether you are a university researcher looking for assistance in AI & ML, or an industry partner looking for help prototyping an AI concept, we can help you.

The GVSU Applied Computing Services Laboratory (ACSL) provides external partners access to the computing expertise of GVSU computing faculty and students.  Projects in the laboratory typically run multiple consecutive semesters and are led by a GVSU faculty member and a domain expert from the partner organization.  Projects can be staffed by undergraduate and/or graduate students as well as faculty.
Project proposals often involved applied research, advanced
  development and/or rapid prototyping that leverage strengths of the
  faculty and/or students assigned.  ACSL currently has a number of
  grant funded initiatives that involve creating software solutions for
  various citizen scientist initiatives.   The best way to
  determine if your project idea is a good fit in ACSL is to simply
  reach out and start
    a conversation with us.
Faculty get involved based on their skills and expertise.   Graduate
  students are recruited to GVSU for specific projects via graduate
  assistantships.  Undergraduates completing ACI residencies are
  assigned to projects based on their skills, interests, and aspirations.
It depends on a number of details, such as the overall scope of the
  project, the staffing needs, etc.  We would be happy to discuss your
  project idea in more detail with you and help establish a budget.
Please get
    in touch with us and let us know what you are looking for.  We’d
  be happy to discuss your project idea further.

The GVSU School of Computing solicits undergraduate software development projects from industry sponsors for its senior capstone course. Senior computer science students in the capstone course will collaborate to develop software systems for sponsor companies. This course is intended to increase the professional readiness of soon-to-graduate computer science students. We request that companies interested in participating submit a short project proposal describing a software development project they are interested in sponsoring. Companies are welcome to submit multiple project proposals to increase the chances of being selected.
Submit Proposal
There are a number of benefits to participating in the computer
  science capstone course as a project sponsor.  First and most
  important, by getting directly involved with the GVSU School of
  Computing and Information Systems, you help us better understand your
  organization’s needs with regard to the skills you look for in CS
  graduates.  This helps our faculty proactively refine and improve our
  overall CS curriculum and keep it relevant to the rapid changes that
  are taking place in the software industry.   A second benefit to your
  organization is the opportunity to “try out” soon-to-graduate computer
  science majors before making a longer-term commitment to hire them as
  employees.  Even if a company doesn’t eventually hire one or more
  students from an assigned capstone team, it gives companies an
  opportunity to evaluate first-hand the level of competence students
  who graduate from our programs typically achieve.  In addition, at the
  present time, given the heavy demand for computing skills, many of our
  computer science majors receive multiple job offers upon graduating. 
  The organizations who participate regular in our senior project course
  develop more mindshare among our students, and tend to have more
  success recruiting our students.   Finally, sponsoring a project is a
  good way to get that “pet” software project or rapid prototype you’ve
  been eagerly pushing for, but haven’t had the time or budget to make
  it happen.  In most cases in addition to the project fee, the only
  cost the sponsor company incurs is the time the company representative
  spends writing the original project description and meeting with
  students over the course of the semester.
If your proposal is assigned a team, you will be billed a flat fee of
  $2,500 at the beginning of the semester.
To have your project proposal considered, simply fill out this
  form. Proposals need not be long and detailed.  Our goal is to
  make the proposal process as lightweight as possible.
Basically you will be asked to provide the following information.
When will teams be assigned to proposals?
The senior project course runs every fall and winter semester.

If you are a GVSU undergraduate majoring in computer science, there are a couple of different ways you can get involved in the Applied Computing Institute.  First, all CS majors must complete CIS 467 – Senior Project.  The content of senior projects is either based on project proposals submitted to the Applied Computing Institute by its corporate partners, or based on startup-up ideas that student teams pitch before the semester begins.   CS majors can also get involved in ACI by applying to the ACI residency program.  Students that are granted a residency will work on sponsored projects in ACI’s Applied Computing Services Laboratory, earning both a wage as well as credit towards their degree program.  ACI residencies can span two or more academic semesters.
There are a limited number of graduate assistantships available to School of CIS graduate students.  Most of these graduate assistantships involved working on sponsored projects with ACI industry partners, or projects sponsored by external grants.
The senior project course (CIS 467) is the capstone of the GVSU computer science major’s program. The course provides an opportunity for students to demonstrate their software development proficiency by working on a real software deliverable.
Learn About Senior Projects
To help encourage student participation in research dissemination, the Applied Computing Institute has established the ACI Student Research Dissemination Grant. The grant is available to all GVSU students planning to present results from a computing-related research project supervised by a GVSU School of Computing faculty member. 
Learn About The Grant
ACI residencies are available to high-aptitude GVSU computer science majors who have been admitted into the program and completed their first two years of coursework. An ACI residency provides a unique opportunity for students to work alongside industry partners. Residencies can be single or multi-semester initiatives.

All GVSU computer science majors must complete the Senior Project course (CIS 467). Students will typically take the course towards the end of their course of study in the program, during their last year. Senior project is an opportunity for students to demonstrate their proficiency as software professionals to the faculty. In other words, over the course of a 15 week semester, students demonstrate all of the skills they have learned over the past 3-4 years in the CS program. In addition, the students acquire additional skills in the area of collaboration, communication, teamwork, estimating effort / complexity, and many other skills needed in a production software development environment. The senior project experience has been designed by the faculty to reproduce with reasonable fidelity, the experience of real-world software development within a supervised academic environment.  Recognizing the different career paths and interests of our students, there are a couple of different paths available for students to pursue within the course: sponsor projects and startup projects.
Sponsored projects are software projects that are sponsored by organizations outside of the GVSU School of Computing. Often these projects are external corporations, but sometimes they may be other organizations within GVSU, or non-profits.  However, all sponsored projects, regardless of the sponsor involve a real software need.  Teams  of 3-4 students are formed by the faculty and assigned to project proposals, based on student skills and interests.  The team is responsible for engaging the client, eliciting the requirements for the project, and delivering the software requested by the end of the semester.
The sponsored project is by far the most common senior project experience for GVSU computer science majors, and representative of the fact that most students who graduate from the program will go on to careers doing software development within the context of established organizations.  It requires the students rapidly assimilate the sponsor’s domain and area of expertise, and understand the requirements well enough to be able to develop the desired software.
While most computer science majors will go on to careers in established organizations, there are students in the program with strong entrepreneurial instincts and aspirations.  The “startup” senior project option has been designed by the faculty for these particular students.  Students interested in establishing their own “startup” project will need to attempt to form a team (e.g. 3-4 students enrolled in the same section of CIS 467) and pitch to the faculty prior to the start of the semester in which they are enrolled in the course.  In addition to a good grasp of what software needs to be developed, the students should also have a handle on similar and/or competing solutions already on the market and why the project they are proposing is a viable one.  Startup projects can be pitched by individuals students (who were unable to establish a team) and may be assigned other students by the faculty, should the proposal have merit.
The faculty will coach / mentor the startup team and play the role of a “virtual” investor over the course of the semester.  In addition, the faculty will introduce the student team to resources within GVSU’s Applied Computing Institute and other GVSU organizations to help guide them towards an actual startup organization, if the student team decides to continuing pursuing the project beyond the duration of the capstone course.
If you are a GVSU CS major anticipating your senior project, your first step is to enroll in CIS 467 course at the appropriate time.  If you are unclear as to when you can take the course, see your academic advisor.  Once enrolled, you will receive an invitation from your instructor to participate in a skills / inventory survey, prior to the beginning of the semester.  It is important that you respond to this survey in a timely manner, as your answers in part will guide the team assignment process.  If you are interested in the start up project path, you can approach your section’s instructor (well before the semester begins!) to discuss further, or you can simply wait for an announcement from your instructor soliciting startup project proposals.  This is typically sent out 3-4 weeks before the beginning of the semester.
Any questions regarding senior projects, can be directed to the current instructors of the course: Dr. Adams and/or Dr. Engelsma.

The ACI Student Research Dissemination Grant
Learn more about the grant
Effective dissemination is an important part of conducting research, as it increases the impact of the research in practice and also provides a basis for further research.  If you are a student involved in a faculty-mentored computing research project it is particularly important for you to participate in research dissemination, as it will help you increase your own impact in the field, network with other researchers in your field, and provide you with an excellent experiential learning opportunity if you are interested in pursuing a career in research.  Often research dissemination takes the form of presenting a paper or a poster at a conference which involves domestic or international travel. 

To help encourage student participation in research dissemination, the Applied Computing Institute has established the ACI Student Research Dissemination Grant.  The grant is available to all GVSU students who are planning to present results from a computing-related research project supervised by a GVSU School of Computing faculty member.

Scraped Text:
The ACI Residency program is an immersive experience designed for GVSU computer science majors.  It involves working on sponsored projects for external organizations within ACI’s Applied Computing Services Laboratory (ACSL).  ACSL projects typically involve GVSU CS faculty members, CIS graduate assistants, undergraduate developers/researchers and domain experts from the sponsoring organization. While project content will vary, students can expect to be exposed to many of the concepts encountered in upper level CS courses, but will likely also gain advanced knowledge that goes beyond what they might receive in a conventional required course or elective.  ACI Residents are expected to have and maintain a GPA at or above 3.25.  In addition to demonstrating software-related proficiencies, they should also have excellent communication skills and perform well in a highly collaborative multidisciplinary team environment.
Undergraduates computer science majors who are awarded an ACI residency (as early as the end of their second year) will receive a competitive wage for the hours they work on ACSL projects. In addition, they will receive credit for a number of required courses in their degree program:
• CIS 350 – Introduction to Software Engineering (3 cr)
• CIS 467 – Capstone Project (3 cr)
• CIS 490 – Internship (3 cr)
• One or two computing electives depending on the project content.
The ACI director will work with CIS faculty and the resident to establish an exact course of study, depending on that particular student’s interests and the work content of the project(s) they are assigned to.  The duration of the residency program will depend on the student’s circumstances at the time of the award, as well as project availability.
Undergraduates interested in applying for an ACI Residency should email their CV to Dr. Engelsma at least one semester in advance, indicating their interest in the program.

Talk Title: Automated Fingerprint Identification
  Systems (AFIS): Challenges and Future Directions

Talk Abstract: Over the past several decades,
  automated fingerprint identification systems (AFIS) have become
  incredibly pervasive throughout society in a number of different
  applications, including, e.g., mobile authentication and payments,
  access control, national ID, border crossing management, and
  forensics. The successes of AFIS can be primarily attributed to their
  high matching accuracy (TAR>99% @ FAR=0.01%) and also the
  statistically studied uniqueness and permanence properties of
  fingerprints. However, despite the tremendous success of AFIS,
  unsolved problems remain. This talk highlights a few of these
  challenging problems and proposes algorithms and methods to address
  them. Specifically, we demonstrate through our work how the latest
  advances in computer vision and deep learning can be used to make
  fingerprint recognition algorithms more accurate, secure, fast, and
  applicable to all ages.  Finally, we conclude by providing direction
  for future research.

Speaker Bio: Joshua J. Engelsma graduated magna cum
  laude with a B.S. degree in computer science from Grand Valley State
  University, Allendale, Michigan, in 2016. He completed his Ph.D. in
  Computer Science at Michigan State University in 2021. His research
  interests include pattern recognition, computer vision, and image
  processing with applications in biometrics. He won the best paper
  award at the 2019 IEEE International Conference on Biometrics (ICB),
  and the 2020 Michigan State University College of Engineering Fitch
  Beach Award. He was an Applied Scientist with Amazon One working on
  palm-print recognition. He currently works as a Senior Scientist at
  Rank One Computing, where he is developing fingerprint-recognition algorithms.

Abu Naweem Khan, a special project Graduate Assistant, and Dr. Rahat
  Rafiq published their research paper titled "A Preliminary
  Analysis of Twitter's LGBTQ+ Discussions" at the 9th
  International Conference on Information Management and Big Data. The
  conference took place in Lima, Peru, from November 16 to November 19, 2022.
In this research, they collected 1.3 million users' data from Twitter
  to understand the macro-level sentiment towards LGBTQ+ communities
  since Twitter's introduction in March 2006. They showed in the paper
  that emotions such as joy and anger and toxicity such as identity
  attacks and threats are more prevalent in Twitter conversations
  related to LGBTQ+ communities. Moreover, they also saw a significant
  gradual increase in activity on Twitter over the recent six years for
  positive emotions in LGBTQ+-related conversations.
Dr. Rafiq, during his stay, also tried out Peru's world-famous
  seafood cuisine and visited the gothic cathedrals that litter the city
  of Lima, the capital and the biggest city in Peru.

Talk Title: The Visible Embryo Project: Following the
  connections from chick embryos to Bitcoin.

Talk Abstract: Dr. Doyle will discuss how a project
  created to help researchers in developmental biology led to several
  spin-off technologies that changed the world, including the cloud,
  spatial biology, Web security, and the first distributed blockchain system.

Speaker Bio: Dr. Michael Doyle is the creator of
  fundamental technologies that underlie such revolutionary products as
  the Cloud, blockchain/cryptocurrency systems, spatial transcriptomics,
  and mobile intelligent assistants. Dr. Doyle received his Ph.D. from
  the Department of Cell & Structural Biology at the University of
  Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). He then served as Director of the
  UIC Biomedical Visualization Laboratory from 1989 to 1993. While on
  sabbatical at UIUC working with Dr. Paul Lauterbur (2003 Nobel
  Laureate) on the application of micro-MRI techniques to embryo
  imaging, Dr. Doyle created the Visible Embryo Project (VEP), a
  multi-institutional collaboration to create a national online
  "metacenter" computational and information resource on early
  human development. His creation of transient-key cryptography in the
  late 1990s represented the first forward-signature
  distributed-blockchain system, enabling the later creation of the
  Bitcoin system, and has been adopted in the x9.95 ANSI National
  Standard for secure timestamps. And, his co-invention of the Skybot
  mobile intelligent chatbot system in 2005 pioneered the mobile
  intelligent- assistant product category that is now ubiquitous worldwide.

	October 31, 2022




On September 23, ArtPrize capped off its first annual Tech Week with
  a showcase featuring various local companies and organizations. For
  our part at Grand Valley State University (and more specifically, the
  Applied Computing Institute), we brought along our YouBrush app to
  demonstrate and chat about. 
For those not “in the know”, YouBrush is an iPhone app that was
  designed and built by the ACI for the express purpose of bettering the
  oral care habits of its users. What separates YouBrush from the
  competition is the use of a machine learning algorithm to
  intelligently detect when a user is actually brushing their teeth.
  This functions as an accountability mechanism; whereas other programs
  will simply run down a timer while trusting that you’re brushing,
  YouBrush explicitly requires that you brush in order to increment the
  proverbial timer. This led to many fascinating conversations around
  accountability and encouragement mechanisms at the Tech Showcase,
  often with the particular context of how such mechanisms impact
  different people.
One of the more fascinating discussions was captured in an interview
  with Lindsay Guentzel of the Refocused
  podcast, and focuses on how such designs can have a greater impact
  on individuals with ADHD, and how technology can push the adoption of
  better, healthier habits in a given population. Keep your eyes and
  ears open for more soon!
iPhone users interested in giving a YouBrush a try and download it here.
